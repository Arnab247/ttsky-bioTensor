## How it works

This project implements a 32-bit fixed-point Molecular Dynamics engine. It uses a 
sequential state machine to calculate bonded, angle, and dihedral forces across a 
10-atom chain to simulate protein folding. Data is loaded 8 bits at a time through 
a command-based sequencer.

## How to test

The following documents many of the testbenches used to verify the results.(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oSiXqGyrzSFqt9LysJFsRMUh7Ew06vMUgOWZDqSJrrA/edit?usp=sharing)
